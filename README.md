# Statistical-Machine-Learning-Project-1
## usage
### ANN model
```python
python ann_model.py
```
### Logistic regression model
```python
python logistics.py
```

## File Description
`ann_model.py` and `logistics.py` are two machine learning models.

`read_data.py` used to read data from raw dataset. `new_positive.py` and `new_test.py` used to select data and compute features.

`priorty_queue.py` is the data structure used in this project.
